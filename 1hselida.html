  <h2>THE GAME / RULES</h2>
  <div class="game/rules">
    <ol>

      <h3><b>THE GAME</b></h3>
      <ul>
        The singles game of squash is played by two players, each holding a racket to strike the ball.<br>
        The court, the ball, and the racket must comply with the specifications of the World Squash Federation (WSF).<br>
        Each point begins with a serve, and players alternately strike the ball (rally) until the point ends.<br>
        The rally does not stop until the referee decides.
      </ul>

      <h3><b>SCORING</b></h3>
      <ul>
        The winner of a rally scores 1 point and serves to start the next rally.<br>
        Each game is played to 11 points unless the score reaches 10–10, in which case the game continues<br>
        until one player leads by two points. A match is normally played as the best of 5 games,<br>
        but it can also be played as the best of 3 games.
      </ul>

      <h3><b>INTERFERENCE</b></h3>
      <ul>
        After completing a reasonable follow-through, a player must make every effort so that when the ball rebounds
        from the front wall, the opponent has:<br>
        a clear view of the ball on its return from the front wall,<br>
        unobstructed direct access to the ball,<br>
        sufficient space to make a reasonable swing preparation,<br>
        and the freedom to strike the ball to any part of the front wall.<br>
        Interference occurs when the player fails to provide all of these requirements.<br>
        The striker who believes interference has occurred may stop and request a let.<br>
        This request must be made without undue delay.<br><br>

        <u><b>NOTE:</b></u><br>
        Before accepting any form of request, the referee must be satisfied that the player genuinely requests a let.<br>
        A request for a let also includes a request for a stroke. Normally, only the striker may request a let for interference.<br>
        However, if the non-striker requests a let due to lack of access before the ball reaches the front wall, the request may be considered,
        even if that player is not yet the striker. If the referee is unsure about the reason for the request, they should ask the player for clarification.
        The referee may award a let or stroke without a request by stopping play if necessary, especially for safety reasons.
        If the striker hits the ball and the opponent then requests a let, but the ball subsequently goes down or out, the opponent wins the point.
      </ul>

        The international dimensions of the squash court were standardized in London in the late 1920s and set at
        9.75 m in depth and 6.4 m in width.<br>
        The front wall has an out line at 4.57 m from the floor, which meets the side wall out lines that connect to
        the back wall out line at a height of 2.13 m, defining the upper limits of the court.<br>
        The front wall also features the service line at 1.83 m and a 43 cm metal strip that produces a distinctive sound
        when the ball strikes it. The wooden floor is divided in the middle, with the back section split by the half-court line
        into two quarters, each containing a service box, as shown in the diagrams below.

  <h2>EQUIPMENT</h2>
  <p>
    Racket specifications are defined by the rules of the sport. The first rackets were made of polished wood and natural strings.<br>
    Players adapted the rackets originally designed by Major Walter C. Wingfield for tennis, shortening the handles to make them easier to control.<br>
    The first major change came from Wilson, which introduced the metal frame in 1967 with the T2000 model.<br>
    Since then, composite materials (graphite, kevlar, titanium, boron) have been used, with each company applying and patenting them differently.<br>
    All manufacturers focus on designing rackets that simultaneously offer comfort, power, stability, and vibration protection.<br>
    Modern rackets have maximum dimensions of 68.6 cm in length and 21.5 cm in width, with a string surface area of up to 500 cm² (90 sq in),
    and weights ranging from 210–255 g.
