  <h2><b>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE COURSE AND THE SPORT</b></h2>

  <h4>
    Inspired by our assignment for the Computer Science course and by the inclusion of squash in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles,
    we decided to create a website aiming to promote the sport of squash, which has been growing rapidly in recent years.
    We also present top-quality equipment for the sport—equipment that the world’s leading athletes choose in order to compete at the highest level.
    It is also a fact that the sport has been developing in our country in recent years.
    Greece is regularly represented by national teams in the men’s/women’s/junior and youth categories, which compete every year in Europe.
    However, due to the small number of athletes in our country, the early years of the youth national teams (2015) did not go very well.
    The athletes could not win even a single match against a foreign country. Our first victory came in 2018 against the Belgian team.
    In the following years, more and more wins started to come for the team.
    The men’s team achieved many successes and had strong players in the world rankings.
    Fabian Kalaitzis had reached No. 75 in the previous decade, and Petros Tzamaloukas had reached No. 102 in the same period.
